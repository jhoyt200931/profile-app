        text: "I am currently 25 years of age and I was born and raised in Central New York. I'm the 2nd youngest of 4 children and we grew up in a home without much money, but we always got by. I am a massive Star Wars and comic book fan. My favorite characters are Batman, Spider-Man, Deadpool and The Joker. My love for Star Wars and comic books started at the age of 3 when my father brought home the boxed set of the Star Wars Original Trilogy. According to his stories, he wanted to watch a Star Wars marathon and from the moment he put the first movie in, I sat there and did not move throughout the entire trilogy. I also got my love of technology from my father who went to ITT Technical Institute for a networking degree. When I was a child, my father would always be working on computers and I would always be up behind him asking what the parts were and why they made the computer work."

My interest in technology has persisted all throughout my life. Though at times it did take a backseat to other pursuits for a while."

        text: "Getting into high school, I started to get more into sports and become more physically active than I had typically been to that point. My main sport was football, and it still is my favorite to this day. I turned out to be quite the football player, to the point where the coach kept telling my that I could be scouted by college teams. And at the time, that did seem exciting to me, but it was not my true goal."

        text: "My true goal was to get a job directly out of high school so that I could start to support myself and ease the burden on my family. I succeeded in this goal and moved out of my parents home at the age of 18. I started off in the fast food industry like so many others and eventually found myself doing customer service for AT&T and then later a furniture company."

        text: "It was at this furniture company that my love of technology came back to the forefront for me and started to drive my pursuit to become a developer. Now I'm attempting to break into the tech industry to improve my life and to work in an area that I've always been interested in."
